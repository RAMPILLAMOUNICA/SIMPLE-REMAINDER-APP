# SIMPLE-REMAINDER-APP
A simple Python reminder app.

## Overview
This Python-based reminder application allows users to set a reminder for a specific time. Once the time is reached, the program will print the reminder message on the screen.

## Features

4. Enter the message you want to be reminded of when the time comes.
5. The program will alert you with your reminder when the set time is reached.
